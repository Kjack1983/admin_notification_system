/*
 * Client messaging server v2. 
 * 
 * The application consists of connections library and events that are added
 * using the library's api. Connection library connects different input
 * channels over which the server is receiving information from the outside
 * world. 
 * 
 * Currently there are three channels: Sockets, Redis, Http.The library
 * itself is quite small and simple. Communication with the library is done
 * using the events api, that allows user to add events to the system. In that
 * way building the application consist of adding various events and providing 
 * handlers for these events using the events api. In our implementation we 
 * are adding these events in the app module using number of connections 
 * instances.
 *
 * Clients module adds events for handling clients connections (browsers, 
 * mobile and push registrations and handling)
 *
 * Direct messaging module adds events for handling notification admin panel 
 * (Admin socket connections, message previews, user stats)
 *
 * Market alert module adds events for market alerts handling. Receiving market 
 * alert triggers, transforming it to appropriate formats and sending it to
 * clients over different channels (browser push, mobile push, html alert)
 *
 * Webeyez redis module handles user profile updates from received from 
 * webeyez.
 *
 * User management module is independent module that stores userâ€™s data and 
 * provide various methods for manipulating this data.  These methods are 
 * used by any module that is modifying the state of user profiles.
